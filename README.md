# Mondos-Recipes
A recipe website showcasing all of my favorite food recipes!

This project is to test my basic HTML workflow skills, such as creating the basic DOCTYPE declaration, curating unordered and ordered lists, and many more! I also test out my new Git skills, such as writing commit messages!
